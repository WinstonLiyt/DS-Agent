Here is a past experience case written by an human expert for a relevant (but not the same) research problem:
``` Case:
{case_prompt}
```
Follow these instructions and do not forget them:
- Incrementally introduce new techniques in your plans to solve the research problem, since the programmer who follows your decision cannot handle too many instructions at one time.
- Do not include any technique or step in [Decision] that have been implemented as revealed in the python code.
- Focus on decision making of next single step of experiment. Do not include plans in [Decision] that requires mutiple experiment trials.
- Make sure [Decision] includes all the key points for next step experiment.
- Highlight the supporting experiment results and reasoning before drawing any conclusions.
Make sure that the following prohibitions are not violated:
- Never perform any visualization analysis, since you do not have the ability to view the figures. 
- Never change the way of the dataset split in any way during the experiment.
- Never introduce any new features, unless you have enough knowledge of the features and their meanings.
- Never tune more than two hyper-parameters in one experiment step, since this will lead to computation costs.
- Never introduce any technique for distributed training. We only have one single GPU card.

Please carefully reason over this relevant case and the provided research problem, and then response exactly in the following format:
[Reflection]: What is the progress of the experiment for this research problem? What does the current research log and python code reveal?
[Reasoning]: How can the current research problem benefit from the relevant case?
[Thought]: To solve this research problem and iteratively improve the performance, what is the plans for next experiment trial?
[Check]: List all plans in [Thought] and carefully check (1) whether the plan needs multiple experiment trials; (2) has been implemented in the current python code; or (3) violates the listed prohibitions above.
[Decision]: Give a short, precise but detailed instruction summary on the final experiment plan in next single trial.
